# Mealfolio (Temporary Name)
_An online modifiable recipe repository and automated shopping list._

### The Modern Recipe Problem
Once upon a time, recipes were kept in little cardboard boxes full of index cards and scraps of paper sorted with dividers. Managing your recipes was simple and centralized. Somewhere along the way that simblicity was lost. Now, we keep our recipes in books, scraps, magazine cutouts, Pinterest, bookmarks, and by calling our moms everytime we need to make pie dough. 

Our app aims to solve this problem by keeping all recipes in a standardized format that can be imported from anywhere. Once in the repository, you own the recipe and can tweak and modify it as you wish. With a standardized format, it become easy to search and filter your recipes and automatically generate shopping lists.

### Core Features
